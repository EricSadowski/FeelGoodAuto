      <p> Our first project is a 1937 Packard. It has been a challenging project, but also very fulfilling. 
        Finding suitable replacement parts has been one of the biggest challenges, but we have been able to source most of it needs.
         The car’s exterior has been restored to its original shine. 
         At the end seeing the car comes back to life has been very rewarding. </p>

      The car’s unique features, such as its gull-wing doors, require precise alignment during the restoration process.
       Restoring a classic car like this is a labor of love, but the end result
